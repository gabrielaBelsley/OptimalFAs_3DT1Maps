# Optimal FAs for 3D T1 mapping using VIBE

Run first the script varianceT1SPGR_BeforeScanInVivo.m.
This script calculates the T1 Coefficient of Variation (CoV) for a range of T1s, B1+ factors, VIBE SNRs, B1+ SNRs and different FA combinations.

Then run script varianceT1SPGR_OptimalFAs.m that finds the optimal FAs using a min-max approach. The simulation figures from the paper (Figure 1-3) and Table 1 are generated with this script.
